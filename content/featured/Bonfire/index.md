This is a mobile application for allowing people to schedule their time with others,
in exchange for cryptocurrencies. It is built with React Native and Node.js back-end,
together with PostgreSQL database. The reason for choosing React Native for this project
was to make it a cross-platform application (Android & iOS).

This project is almost finished (as of Feb 2022). There is an ongoing work to integrate
crypto payments and recurring subscription fees for allowing people to post their availbility
time in form of an event.

In the future there would likely be a build-in video conversations possibility, by using
Web RTC technology. Which will greatly help us gain insights into the actual events that
will be taking place between people.
