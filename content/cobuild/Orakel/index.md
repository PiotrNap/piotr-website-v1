This project was a developed in a small dev team of 5 people. We've build a website
for a local company, who's selling printing products and branding solutions to their
clients. My main work was focused on developing an HTML5 Canvas application that allows
people to easily create their own print designs and send them to our client.

This was a very fun project and I enjoyed working with Canvas library in JavaScript (fabric.js).
