Password Chaos is a project that emerged from Gimbalabs team when we've realized the
need of raising awareness about the problem of today's Web 2.0 broken credentials-storing
system. We wanted let people know that their passwords aren't always safe and were
already breached many times in the past.

We've produced our own series of NFTs and released them in 2 'drops' (as of Feb 2022).
I've contributed to our back-end infrastructure as well as integrated it with our front-end
application. We've used Cardano blockchain for minting and selling our NFTs.
