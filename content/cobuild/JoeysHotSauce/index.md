This project was a collaboration of Gimbalabs, Joey's Hot Sauce and Fire & Salt Regenerative Beef Company.
Part of proceeds were donated to rise awereness of regenerative agriculture and further support of it.
In this project I've managed to integrate our front-end NFT selling flow and set up our back-end Node.js
application, to handle the communication between Cardano blockchain, our front-end and PostgreSQL database.

Each person was able to purchase a Limited Edition Joey's Hot Sauce and receive 2 NFTs: unique image from our
[documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMUEqw8CfHs) and an animated NFT prepared by artists [DPAK](https://www.instagram.com/therealdpak/)
& [Farouk Alou](https://www.instagram.com/therealdpak/).
